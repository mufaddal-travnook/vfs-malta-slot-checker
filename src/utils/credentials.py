"""Multiple VFS credentials with hour-based rotation.

You can run the bot under several VFS accounts and rotate them by the clock hour,
so a different account is used each hour (spreading load / avoiding rate limits).

Accounts live in a dedicated, gitignored file `config/credentials.local.ini`:

    [cred1]
    email = a@example.com
    password = your-password-1

    [cred2]
    email = b@example.com
    password = your-password-2
    ; ... add as many [credN] sections as you like, in order

Rotation: the active account is chosen by the clock hour, offset so the FIRST
account is used at the first run hour of the day (06:00):

    index = (hour - START_HOUR) % number_of_accounts

so cred1 -> 06:00, cred2 -> 07:00, ... wrapping after N hours. Both runs within
an hour (e.g. :29 and :59) use the same account.

If the credentials file is absent or empty, this falls back to the single
[vfs-credential] account in config.ini / config.local.ini — so existing setups
keep working unchanged.
